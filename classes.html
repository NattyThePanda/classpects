		<td>Heirs are very diverse, friendly but easily influenced by others.<br/> Usually the Aspect is the one who dominates their personality, which is unique to the Heir class.</td>
		<td>Seers love understanding matters that actually matters to them, they are very wary of what's wrong and what's right.<br/>Seers are also very frindly, but really serious when the moment calls for them.</td>
		<td>Knights wear armor, which is self-explanatory, Knight players usually know very little about themselves and wear masks to hide their true selves.</td>
		<td>Witch players are the friendliest of all the classes, but they are very manipulative and ruthless in their worst.</td>

		<td>Maids act like caretakers, they love doing their best to their best companions, and they work hard to bring a better future.</td>
		<td>Pages start useless and are very hard on themselves, often in need of others to make them strong. Pages are usually very wise, friendly and good mannered.</td>
		<td>Rogue players are the ones who needs others the most, they are the most generous players of all the classes, caring first about others.</td>
		<td>Thief players are the most self-centered of all the classes, very proud of themselves and very selfish, but also very good partners and workers.</td>

		<td>Princes have a moral that everything must be perfect in their own vision, if they don't, they will destroy it to make what they want a reality.<br/> And just like the real world princes, nothing is mundane to them.</td>
		<td>Bard players are instruments of greatness, but also of destruction.<br/>Usually they are keys to open either great or bad things. <br/>
		Bards also love to talk about themselves, but also about others.</td>
		<td>Mage players are the most helpful of the classes, what drives them is the feeling or progress. They do right for right's sake, but usually are very hard on themselves.</td>
		<td>Sylph players are, in essence, healers, they love taking care of others' problems, not only physical but emotional aswell.<br/>The bad thing about them is that they always want to keep track of one's life.</td>
